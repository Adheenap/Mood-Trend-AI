Mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety, and emotional fatigue often develop gradually and may remain undetected until they significantly impact well-being. Conventional mental health assessments typically rely on periodic questionnaires or subjective self-evaluation, which may not effectively capture continuous emotional fluctuations. To address this challenge, this project introduces Mind Trace-AI, an AI-driven mental health monitoring system designed to analyze daily emotional patterns and detect emotional drift over time.
